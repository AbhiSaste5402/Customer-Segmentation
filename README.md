# Customer-Segmentation

The goal of this project was to help an automobile company expand its customer base by identifying new markets and grouping customers based on their behavior. Clustering, a popular technique in unsupervised machine learning, was used to group similar observations together based on their features.

Before beginning the clustering process, the data was prepared and visualized to gain insights and to ensure that the data was suitable for clustering. Next, three different methods were used to determine the optimal number of clusters, namely the silhouette, WCSS, and Calinski-Harabasz methods. These methods evaluated the quality and effectiveness of clustering by measuring the differences between clusters and their compactness.

Once the optimal number of clusters was determined, k-means clustering was performed on the data. K-means clustering is a widely used method that partitions n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This method is relatively simple and efficient, making it a popular choice for clustering large datasets with a large number of observations.

The results of the clustering analysis can provide valuable insights to the automobile company by enabling them to perform targeted outreach and communication to different segments of customers. By tailoring marketing strategies and communication to specific customer segments, the company can improve customer retention and increase sales.

Clustering is a powerful technique with various applications in marketing, finance, and healthcare. In marketing, clustering can be used to segment customers based on demographics, behavior, or other factors to personalize marketing campaigns and improve customer retention. In finance, clustering can be used to identify fraud or to group similar investments together. In healthcare, clustering can be used to identify patient groups that require specific treatments or interventions. Overall, clustering is a valuable tool for discovering patterns in large datasets and can provide valuable insights to businesses and organizations across various industries.
